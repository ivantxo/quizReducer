# React Quiz

In this project I created a React quiz in order to learn useReducer hook

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

To run a fake API that will consume data/questions.json

## Lessons learned

- State management
- Created a fake API with json-server: npm i json-server
- Consumed fake API with useEffect
